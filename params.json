{"name":"Trotter-Suzuki-Mpi","tagline":"Distributed Trotter-Suzuki solver","body":"Distributed Trotter-Suzuki Solver\r\n==\r\n\r\nThis is a distributed variant of efficient implementations of a Trotter-Suzuki solver with high-performance multicore, SSE, GPU, and hybrid kernels. The kernels are based on the [implementation](https://bitbucket.org/zzzoom/trottersuzuki) by \r\nCarlos Bederi√°n\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n==\r\nAn MPI implementation is required for compiling. To use the GPU-accelerated version, CUDA and a GPU with at least Compute Cabapility 2.0 are necessary.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n==\r\n\r\nA test example is included. Usage: trottertest [OPTIONS]. \r\n\r\nArguments:\r\n\r\n    -d NUMBER     Matrix dimension (default: 640)\r\n    -i NUMBER     Number of iterations (default: 1000)\r\n    -k NUMBER     Kernel type (default: 0): \r\n                    0: CPU, cache-optimized\r\n                    1: CPU, SSE and cache-optimized\r\n                    2: GPU\r\n                    3: Hybrid CPU-GPU (experimental)                    \r\n    -s NUMBER     Snapshots are taken at every NUMBER of iterations.\r\n                    Zero means no snapshots. Default: 0.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    mpirun -np 4 build/trottertest -k 0 -i 100 -d 640 -s 10\r\n\r\nIn case of the SSE kernel, the chunk of the matrix assigned to a node, that is a tile, must have a width that is divisible by two. This puts a constraint on the possible matrix sizes. For instance, running twelve MPI threads in a 4x3 configuration, the dimensions must be divisible by six and eight.\r\n\r\nThe hybrid kernel is experimental. It splits the work between the GPU and the CPU. It uses one MPI thread per GPU, and uses OpenMP to use parallelism on the CPU. It is efficient if the matrix does not fit the GPU memory. For instance, given twelve physical cores in a single node with two Tesla C2050 GPUs, a 14,000x14,000 would not fit the GPU memory. The following command would calculate the part that does not fit the device memory on the CPU:\r\n\r\n    OMP_NUM_THREADS=6 mpirun -np 2 build/trottertest -k 3 -i 100 -d 14000\r\n\r\nThe included shell script single2double.sh generates a double precision variant. Executing it will overwrite the single precision source code.\r\n\r\nCompilation & Installation\r\n==\r\nFrom GIT repository first run\r\n\r\n    $ ./autogen.sh\r\n\r\nThen follow the standard POSIX procedure:\r\n\r\n    $ ./configure [options]\r\n    $ make\r\n    $ make install\r\n\r\n\r\nOptions for configure\r\n\r\n    --prefix=PATH           Set directory prefix for installation\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the executable is installed into /usr/local. If you prefer a\r\ndifferent location, use this option to select an installation\r\ndirectory.\r\n\r\n    --with-mpi=MPIROOT      Use MPI root directory.\r\n    --with-mpi-compilers=DIR or --with-mpi-compilers=yes\r\n                              use MPI compiler (mpicxx) found in directory DIR, or\r\n                              in your PATH if =yes\r\n    --with-mpi-libs=\"LIBS\"  MPI libraries [default \"-lmpi\"]\r\n    --with-mpi-incdir=DIR   MPI include directory [default MPIROOT/include]\r\n    --with-mpi-libdir=DIR   MPI library directory [default MPIROOT/lib]\r\n\r\nThe above flags allow the identification of the correct MPI library the user wishes to use. The flags are especially useful if MPI is installed in a non-standard location, or when multiple MPI libraries are available.\r\n\r\n    --with-cuda=/path/to/cuda           Set path for CUDA\r\n\r\nThe configure script looks for CUDA in /usr/local/cuda. If your installation is not there, then specify the path with this parameter. If you do not want CUDA enabled, set the parameter to ```--without-cuda```.\r\n\r\nCitation\r\n==\r\nFurther details are available in the following paper:\r\n\r\nWittek, P. and Cucchietti, F.M.
