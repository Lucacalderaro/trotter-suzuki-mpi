Examples
========
The examples below show how to use the C++ API. If you are interested in the Python or the MATLAB version, refer to [Read the Docs](https://trotter-suzuki-mpi.readthedocs.org) and [FileExchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/51975-mextrotter), respectively.

Examples of using the API are included in the source tree. The respective files are in the examples folder:

  - `exponential_initial_state.cpp`: Time evolution of a particle in a box with an exponential initial state with periodic boundary conditions.
  - `gaussian-like_initial_state.cpp`: Time evolution of a particle in a box with a Gaussian-like initial state with closed boundary conditions.
  - `imag_evolution.cpp`: Imaginary time evolution of an exponential initial state with periodic boundary conditions.
  - `sinusoid_initial_state.cpp`: Time evolution of a particle in a box with a sinusoid initial state with periodic boundary conditions.
  - `groundstate_of_BEC_in_harmonic_pot.cpp`: Imaginary time evolution of a Bose-Einstein Condensate trapped in a harmonic potential.
