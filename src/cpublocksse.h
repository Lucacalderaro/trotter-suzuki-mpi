/**
 * \brief This class define the SSE kernel.
 *
 * This kernel provides real time and imaginary time evolution exploiting CPUs.
 * It implements a solver for a single wave function, whose evolution is governed by linear Schrodinger equation. The Hamiltonian of the physical system includes:
 *  - static external potential
 * 
 * NB: the single N x N lattice tile is divided in N/2 x N/2 small 2 x 2 squared blocks. Each top-left complex number is stored in buffers pointed by r00[0] and i00[0]; 
 * Each top-right complex number is stored in buffers pointed by r01[0] and i01[0]; Each bottom-left complex number is stored in buffers pointed by r10[0] and i10[0]; 
 * Each bottom-right complex number is stored in buffers pointed by r11[0] and i11[0]. The same logic is applied to the storage of the matrix representation of the operator 
 * given by the exponential of external potential.
