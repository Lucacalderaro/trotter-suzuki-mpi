Trotter-Suzuki-MPI - MATLAB Interface
=====================================

The module is a massively parallel implementation of the Trotter-Suzuki approximation to simulate the evolution of quantum systems classically. It relies on interfacing with C++ code with OpenMP for multicore execution.

Key features of the MATLAB interface:

* Fast execution by parallelization: OpenMP.
* Multi-platform: Linux, OS X, and Windows are supported.
