 * \brief This class define the CPU kernel.
 *
 * This kernel provides real time and imaginary time evolution exploiting CPUs.
 * It implements a solver for a single wave function, whose evolution is governed by nonlinear Schrodinger equation. The Hamiltonian of the physical system includes:
 *  - static external potential
 *  - density self-interacting term
 *  - rotational energy
